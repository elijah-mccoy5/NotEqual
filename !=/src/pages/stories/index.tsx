            <p>
              Nina describes being discriminated against and harassed at work
              because of her race. We explain how the Equal Opportunity Act
              relates to her situation, and how the Commission can help people
              who have a similar experience.

            “I’m proud of my Turkish heritage, and I’ve really only experienced
            racism a couple of times in my life. I had this one terrible job in
            a restaurant. I liked the hours, because I was still studying, but
            it wasn’t a great place to work. The owner could be quite racist –
            sometimes I’d hear him talk about customers and be pretty disgusted.
            He wasn’t particularly friendly to me, but I just got on with the
            job. One day, he called me into a meeting and accused me of
            stealing. I denied it and asked what evidence he had. I’m a hard
            worker and I just wouldn’t do something like that. He told me my
            shifts would be suspended while he ‘investigated’ further. It wasn’t
            clear how he intended to do this, but it meant I lost a week’s worth
            of shifts. I spoke to a couple of the other staff, all Aussies, and
            none of them had to meet with him like that.When I did come back, I
            could tell he’d talked about me to the other staff. I felt like I
            was on the outer, and a couple of them were overtly hostile. They’d
            make fun of my accent and say disparaging things about Turkish
            people, Muslims and migrants. I ended up quitting the job, but I
            didn’t want anyone else to go through that. A friend put me in touch
            with the Commission and they arranged a meeting with the owner of
            the bar. He was pretty defensive and a bit reluctant to admit fault,
            but he agreed to pay me a small amount of compensation and provide a
            written reference for me.” The incidents portrayed in this story are
            inspired by real complaints received by the Commission, but all
            names and other identifying details have been changed.
